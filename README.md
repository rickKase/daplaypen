# daplaypen

This repository is a meta workspace for a collection of Rust crates.  New
projects can be added under the workspace to experiment with language features
or larger application ideas.

The first member crate is **feature_tests**, which contains a suite of unit
tests that exercise basic Rust language features.  It serves as a template for
adding more crates that validate additional capabilities of the language or
standard library.
